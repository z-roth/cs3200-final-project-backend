## CS3200 Final Project: Back End

Welcome!

This is the back end repository for my final project.

To use the front-end, this back-end must be running first.

Firstly, make sure you have Node installed and added to PATH. You can install Node at https://nodejs.org/en/download/. I am using Node version `16.15.1` to develop this project. That is the LTS option on the downloads page.

Additionally, the database must also be running on your computer. Please load in the data from the database dump. The password for the connection is set to "password" - you can change this by changing that line marked in `index.js`. Same for root as user.

After verifying node is installed with `node -v` on the command line, navigate to the root folder of this repository and run `npm install`. This will install all of the dependencies used to build this project. After that is complete, run `node index.js` to start the program. By default, the program will run on localhost:5000. Verify this with command line output from the program that states "Now listening on port 5000".

All of this setup can be quite complex and there is a lot of room for error. If you need any help at all, please email me and I would be happy to promptly assist!
